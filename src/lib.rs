#![deny(missing_docs)]
//! Imara-diff is a solid (imara in Swahili) diff library for Rust.
//! Solid refers to the fact that imara-diff provides very good runtime performance even
//! in pathological cases so that your application never appears to freeze while waiting on a diff.
//! The performance improvements are achieved using battle tested heuristics used in gnu-diff and git
//! that are known to yield fast runtime and performance.
//!
//! Imara-diff is also designed to be flexible so that it can be used with arbitrary collections and
//! not just lists and strings and even allows reusing large parts of the computation when
//! comparing the same file to multiple different files.
//!
//! Imara-diff provides two diff algorithms:
//!
//! * The linear-space variant of the well known [**Myers** algorithm](http://www.xmailserver.org/diff2.pdf)
//! * The **Histogram** algorithm which is a variant of the patience diff algorithm.
//!
//! Myers algorithm has been enhanced with preprocessing and multiple heuristics to ensure fast runtime in pathological
//! cases to avoid quadratic time complexity and closely matches the behavior of gnu-diff and git.
//! The Histogram algorithm was originally ported from git but has been heavily optimized.
//! The **Histogram algorithm outperforms Myers diff** by 10% - 100% across a **wide variety of workloads**.
//!
//! Imara-diffs algorithms have been benchmarked over a wide variety of real-world code.
//! For example, while comparing multiple different Linux kernel versions, it performs up to 30 times better than the `similar` crate:
#![cfg_attr(doc, doc=concat!("<img width=\"600\" class=\"figure\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,", include_str!("../plots/linux_comparison.svg.base64"), "\"></img>"))]
//!
//! # API Overview
//!
//! ## Preparing the input
//! To compute a diff, an input sequence is required. `imara-diff` computes diffs on abstract
//! sequences represented as a slice of IDs/tokens: [`Token`]. To create
//! such a sequence from your input type (for example, text), the input needs to be interned.
//! For that `imara-diff` provides utilities in the form of the [`InternedInput`] struct and
//! the `TokenSource` trait to construct it. [`InternedInput`] contains the two sides of
//! the diff (used while computing the diff). As well as the interner that allows mapping
//! back tokens to their original data.
//!
//! The most common use case for diff is comparing text. `&str` implements `TokenSource`
//! by default to segment the text into lines. So creating an input for a text-based diff usually
//! looks something like the following:
//!
//! ```
//! # use imara_diff::InternedInput;
//! #
//! let before = "abc\ndef";
//! let after = "abc\ndefg";
//! let input = InternedInput::new(before, after);
//! assert_eq!(input.interner[input.before[0]], "abc\n");
//! ```
//!
//! Note that interning inputs is optional, and you could choose a different strategy
//! for creating a sequence of tokens. Instead of using the [`Diff::compute`] function,
//! [`Diff::compute_with`] can be used to provide a list of tokens directly, entirely
//! bypassing the interning step.
//!
//! ## Computing the Diff
//!
//! A diff of two sequences is represented by the [`Diff`] struct and computed by
//! [`Diff::compute`] / [`Diff::compute_with`]. An algorithm can also be chosen here.
//! In most situations, [`Algorithm::Histogram`] is a good choice; refer to the docs
//! of [`Algorithm`] for more details.
//!
//! After the initial computation, the diff can be *postprocessed*. If the diff is shown
//! to a human in some way (even indirectly), you always want to use this.
//!
//! However, when only counting the number of changed tokens quickly, this can be skipped.
//! The postprocessing allows you to provide your own
//! heuristic for selecting a slider position. An indentation-based heuristic is provided,
//! which is a good fit for all text-based line diffs. The internals of the heuristic are
//! public, so a tweaked heuristic can be built on top.
//!
//! ```
//! # use imara_diff::{InternedInput, Diff, Algorithm};
//! #
//! let before = "abc\ndef";
//! let after = "abc\ndefg";
//! let input = InternedInput::new(before, after);
//! let mut diff = Diff::compute(Algorithm::Histogram, &input);
//! diff.postprocess_lines(&input);
//! assert!(!diff.is_removed(0) && !diff.is_added(0));
//! assert!(diff.is_removed(1) && diff.is_added(1));
//! ```
//!
//! ## Accessing results
//!
//! [`Diff`] allows querying whether a particular position was removed/added on either
//! side of the diff with [`Diff::is_removed`] / [`Diff::is_added`]. The number
//! of additions/removals can be quickly counted with [`Diff::count_removals`] /
//! [`Diff::count_additions`]. The most powerful/useful interface is the hunk iterator
//! [`Diff::hunks`], which returns a list of additions/removals/modifications in the
//! order that they appear in the input.
//!
//! Finally, if the `unified_diff` feature is enabled, a diff can be printed with
//! [`Diff::unified_diff`] to print a unified diff/patch as shown by `git diff` or `diff
//! -u`. Note that while the unified diff has a decent amount of flexibility, it is fairly
//! simplistic and not every formatting may be possible. It's meant to cover common
//! situations but not cover every advanced use case. Instead, if you need more advanced
//! printing, build your own printer on top of the [`Diff::hunks`] iterator; for that, you can
//! take inspiration from the built-in printer.
//!
//! ```
//! # use imara_diff::{InternedInput, Diff, Algorithm, BasicLineDiffPrinter, UnifiedDiffConfig};
//! #
//!
//! let before = r#"fn foo() -> Bar {
//!     let mut foo = 2;
